      <h1>Tutorial 12a</h1>
      <p>This tutorial demonstrates updating objects in state: for the following example the mouse should move the red circle around the screen, but depends on the state function being called with the cursor x, y position and not just applying the properties to the object.<a href="https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state">please see</a> </p>

      <h1>Tutorial 12b</h1>
      <p>This tutorial demonstrates updating objects in statee: in this example the form should work by the text fields being modified and updating the content below the form. But the text fields wont update if the properties are modified directly and not by state The form on the right should work and the next line form should contain a single handler that handles all three form items and properties.<a href="https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state">please see</a> </p>

      <h1>Tutorial 12c</h1>
      <p>This tutorial demonstrates updating objects in statee: 
        in this example, the state is a nested object and so the full classification of the state is used to update the specific items.<a href="https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state">please see</a> </p>

      <h1>Tutorial 12d</h1>
      <p>This tutorial demonstrates updating objects in statee: 
        in this example, the state is a updated using immer, a helper mechanism to simplify making state changes.
        But otherwise this example should work as the previous one.<a href="https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state">please see</a> </p>

      <h1>Tutorial 12e</h1>
      <p>This section is a bugfix. In the original code, the button does not increment untilt the first textbox is changed and the second text box crashes on changes. The code here should work and allow the increment button to increment and the text boxes to be edited without crashing.<a href="https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state">please see</a> </p>

      <h1>Tutorial 12f</h1>
      <p>This section is a bugfix. In the original code, the box small moves fine, but when the color dropdown is changed, so does the large box. The solution below should allow only the small box to move.<a href="https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state">please see</a> </p>

      <h1>Tutorial 12g</h1>
      <p>This section is a bugfix. Same code as the previous example but solving with Immer. The solution below should allow only the small box to move.<a href="https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state">please see</a> </p>

      <h1>Code Section</h1>
      <p>This section displays the code for the previous sections and has high probability for being slightly out of date.
        The code is generated by taking the files replacing the \r\n sequence with \\n, a double space with a \\t, and any " characters with \"
        which should have the effect of serializing the code.
