      <h1>Tutorial 11a</h1>
      <p>This tutorial demonstrates component state concepts adding multiple times: When the button is clicked the add function is called three times, but only adds once due to the state not changing more than once per render <a href="https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates">please see</a> </p>

      <p>This tutorial demonstrates component state concepts adding multiple times with a state function: When the button is clicked in this example the function to calculate is passed to the state change function and allows the calculation of the state to be incrementally modified <a href="https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates">please see</a> </p>

      <h1>Tutorial 11c</h1>
      <p>This tutorial demonstrates component state concepts adding multiple times with a state function: When the button is clicked in this example the function to calculate is passed to the state change function after a state change set function is called. In this case, the state appears to change correctly but only because the second function chains the update from the first.<a href="https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates">please see</a> </p>

      <p>This tutorial demonstrates component state concepts adding multiple times with a state function: When the button is clicked in this example the function to calculate is passed to the state change function after a state change set function is called, then a setstate function is called again. In this case, the final setState function overrides anything that happened before it.<a href="https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates">please see</a> </p>

      <h1>Code Section</h1>
      <p>This section displays the code for the previous sections and has high probability for being slightly out of date.
        The code is generated by taking the files replacing the \r\n sequence with \\n, a double space with a \\t, and any " characters with \"
        which should have the effect of serializing the code.
