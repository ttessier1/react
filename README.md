This repository is a collection of tutorial completions done by yours truly to learn and or reenforce react development techniques.

The tutorials are from: https://react.dev/learn and the attempt was to as closely follow the order of the tutorials/lessons as possible.

<b>Tutorial 1:</b>
<p>Tutorial 1 is more or less a hello world of sorts which demonstrates the basics of how a react component is composed of html like syntax returned from a javascript component and consumed by react. This tutorial also demonstrates the face that a component can be repeated easily with markup.

A visible demonstration may be found at https://www.swhistlesoft.com/demo/demolist/react/tutorial1
